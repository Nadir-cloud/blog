# ⚙️ Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)  

CI/CD is a set of practices in software development aimed at speeding up and improving the quality of code delivery.  

---

## 🔧 What is CI (Continuous Integration)?  

**Continuous Integration** is the process of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository.  
Each change is automatically verified through:  

- ✅ Project build  
- 🧪 Running tests  
- 🔍 Code analysis (linters, static analysis)  

This way, errors are detected as early as possible.  

---

## 🚀 What is CD (Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment)?  

- **Continuous Delivery** — automating the process of preparing code for release.  
- **Continuous Deployment** — one step further: the code is automatically deployed to a server or cloud after successfully passing tests.  

Benefits:  
- 📦 Faster delivery of new features to users  
- 🔒 Reduced risks through smaller, more frequent releases  
- ⚡ Minimization of manual operations

## 🛠️ Popular CI/CD Tools  

- **GitHub Actions** — built-in pipelines for GitHub projects.  
- **GitLab CI/CD** — a powerful tool for DevOps workflows.  
- **Jenkins** — a universal automation system.  
- **CircleCI** — a cloud solution for CI/CD.

## 📑 Application in Student Projects  

Even students can benefit from using CI/CD:  
- 📝 Automatic checking of homework and projects.  
- 👥 Teamwork with transparent quality control.  
- 🌍 Deploying projects to GitHub Pages or cloud platforms.

💡 **Conclusion:** CI/CD helps not only professional teams but also students — it teaches development discipline, improves code quality, and simplifies project work.
