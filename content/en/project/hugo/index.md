## 🌐 My Project: Personal Academic Website  

In the digital age, it’s important for a researcher or student to have a **personal online portfolio**. It helps present academic interests, publications, and projects to a broad audience. I chose **Hugo Academic (now — Wowchemy Academic)** — a convenient platform for building academic websites.  

---

### 🔧 Why Hugo Academic?  
- It’s a **static site**, which makes it fast and secure.  
- Easy integration with **Markdown** — you can write posts and notes in a simple format.  
- Support for **scholarly profiles** (ORCID, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, etc.).  
- Flexible customization: you can style the site as a personal portfolio or a full-fledged research page.

### 🚀 What I did  
1. 📦 Installed Hugo and the Academic theme.  
2. 📝 Configured the student profile: added information about myself, studies, and research interests.  
3. 🔗 Linked profiles:  
   - [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)  
   - [ORCID](https://orcid.org/)  
   - [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/)  
   - [Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/)  
   - [GitHub](https://github.com/)  
4. 🖼️ Added sections: *About, Education, Skills, Publications, Projects*.  
5. 🌍 Set up deployment to **GitHub Pages** so the site is available online.  

---

### 📑 Outcome  
Now I have a **personal portfolio site** where I can:  
- showcase academic interests and achievements,  
- share projects and publications,  
- stay in touch with peers and professors.  

This is a great start for a career in science and business informatics, as the site helps stand out among students and shows a serious attitude toward the profession.  

---

### ✨ What’s next?  
- I’ll add a *Blog* section to publish notes about my research and study projects.  
- I’ll set up integration with **Google Scholar** to fetch publications automatically.  
- I plan to make an English version of the site.

💡 Tip: you can start with the basic Hugo Academic setup — everything can be configured gradually. The main thing is not to be afraid to try and improve the site step by step.
